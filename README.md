# Running the app
1. Clone it or extract it!
2. cd into the root directory of it.
3. run `yarn`.
4. Copy `next.config.example.json` and rename your copy to `next.config.json`.
5. Ask a college where to get the secrets and env vars to fill up `next.config.json`.
6. Copy `.example.env` and rename your copy to `.env` then repeat step 5.
7. Run `yarn dev`.
8. Open Chrome on [Localhost](http://localhost:3333/).
9. Enjoy!


## Notes:
1. You might need to have `next.js` installed globally in order for the project ot work.
2. Apollo and GraphQl are setup and ready to be used.
3. Storybook is setup and ready to be used with `yarn storybook`.
4. Used Atomic Design. Tried to stick to its rules as much as the time span allowed.
5. Every text that's abbreviated with `[s]` when you switch the language is a place holder for actual Spanish translation. 


# Things I Wanted to Show Case in This Project:
1. Ability to write a scalable code base from scratch.
2. Match a design as close to pixel-perfect as possible.
3. Good mobile responsiveness.
4. Reusability and structure of code.
5. Adapting to use new tools and libraries like `next.js`.
6. Making use of existing libraries like `Material UI`.
7. Have the basis for and implementing a design style-guide.
8. Good coding ethics and practices.
9. Nice-to-look-at animations.


## Given more time I would've addressed these issues:
1. Slider animation.
2. Tightened spacing and typography to be pixel-perfect with design.
3. Currently only the dev version works and only on Chrome as it does no transpiling. I would've loved to build and deploy it to address all cross-browser compatibility issues.
4. Better error handling.
5. Stories for all the components.
